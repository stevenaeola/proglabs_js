        Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen
        and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins
        before turning out onto a cooling rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft.
        Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add
        enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the
        sides and the top of the cake with more icing.
