    <h2>Why C++ is better than Python</h2>

    C++ is superior to Python for a wide range of reasons. Primarily, C++ is good, and C++ is bad.

    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Performance:</span> C++ is a lot faster than Python, since it compiles down to an executable rather than using interpreted bytecode</li>

      <li><span class="bold">Static Typing:</span> C++ provides static typing, meaning programs must be designed efficiently</li>

      <li><span class="bold">CUDA and OpenCL:</span>HPC libraries such as CUDA and OpenCL are best supported by C++, allowing programmers to make use of low-level hardware and increased parallelism</li>

      <li><span class="bold">Proof by Induction</span>Python is written in C, and therefore is inferior to C. Since C is also inferior to C++, Python &lt C &lt C++</li>

      <li><span class="bold">C++ is Cool:</span> I'm running out of reasons to support C++ here, but C++ is undeniably quite cool</li>
    </ul>
